Given a question and an answer, analyze the complexity of each sentence in the answer. Break down each sentence into one or more fully understandable statements. Ensure that no pronouns are used in any statement. Format the outputs in JSON.

Example Input:
Question: Who was Albert Einstein and what is he best known for?
Answer: He was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. He was best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.

Example Output:
["Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist.", "Albert Einstein is recognized as one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.","Albert Einstein was best known for developing the theory of relativity.","Albert Einstein also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics."]

Given a ground truth and an answer statements, analyze each statement and classify them in one of the following categories: TP (true positive): statements that are present in answer that are also directly supported by the one or more statements in ground truth, FP (false positive): statements present in the answer but not directly supported by any statement in ground truth, FN (false negative): statements found in the ground truth but not present in answer.

FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are given a question and a reference answer. Break down the reference answer into a list of distinct factual statements (facts) that could be independently verified.
Output them as a JSON list of strings under the 'facts' field.

Example
Input:
  Question: "What causes seasons?"
  Reference: "Seasonal changes result from Earth's axial tilt. This tilt causes different hemispheres to receive varying sunlight."

Output:
{{
  "facts": [
    "Seasonal changes result from Earth's axial tilt",

FACT_COVERAGE_PROMPT = """
### Task
For each factual statement from the reference, determine if it's covered in the response.
Respond ONLY with a JSON object containing a "classifications" list. Each item should have:
- "statement": the exact fact from reference
- "attributed": 1 if covered, 0 if not

### Example
Response: "Seasons are caused by Earth's tilted axis"
Reference Facts: [
  "Seasonal changes result from Earth's axial tilt",
  "The axial tilt causes different hemispheres to receive varying sunlight"

CONTEXT_RELEVANCE_PROMPT = """
### Instructions
You are a world class expert designed to evaluate the relevance score of a Context in order to answer the Question.
Your task is to determine if the Context contains proper information to answer the Question.
Do not rely on your previous knowledge about the Question.
Use only what is written in the Context and in the Question.

Scoring rules:
0. If the context does not contain any relevant information to answer the question, score 0.
1. If the context partially contains relevant information to answer the question, score 1.
2. If the context fully contains relevant information to answer the question, score 2.

Output format:
You must output strictly in JSON format with a single key "score".
No explanation, no additional text.

Example:
Question: What is the capital of France?
Context: Paris is the capital of France.
Output:
{{ "score": 2 }}
